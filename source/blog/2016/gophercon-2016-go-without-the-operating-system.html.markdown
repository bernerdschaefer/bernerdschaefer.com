title: "GopherCon 2016: Go Without the Operating System"
teaser: >
  I spoke at GopherCon 2016 about AtmanOS, a system that allows you to run Go
  programs without a conventional operating system.

> Go lets you to compile your program into stand-alone binaries which can be
> safely shared across systems without worrying about a missing dependency.
>
> But thereâ€™s one thing even a stand-alone executable depends on: the operating
> system. What if you could remove that dependency, too?

I gave the first recorded talk about [AtmanOS] at GopherCon 2016. The entire
experience was fantastic.

I'm honored to have had the chance to share my personal project with so many of
my peers, and appreciative of all the great feedback I received.

Here's the recording of the talk ([slides]):
