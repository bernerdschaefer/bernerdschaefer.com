<h2>Bringing Java to the Ruby World - JRubyConf 2010</h2>

<p>
  Welcome! Below you can find the slides from my presentation as JRubyConf
  2010. Most of the presentation was spent looking through some sample and
  production applications which make use of jruby-jars. Links to each are also
  below. Look for the video soon, as well as some blog posts examining each
  of the projects.

  Once you hit the "To the Terminal!" slide, you can check out the code
  samples below. They're also linked directly in the slideshow.
</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  I demonstrated three techniques for working with jruby-jars, each with a
  different project or code sample. Here's the code:
</p>

<h4>Standalone</h4>
<p>
  Here we look at the first step to understanding how jruby-jars is used, by
  writing a simple wrapper script to provide us a "jruby" executable.
</p>
<p>Look at the code for <a href="http://gist.github.com/638382">bin/jruby</a>.</p>

<h4>REST</h4>
<p>
  Taking these concepts to the next level, we have "Rucene", a sample
  application which uses Sinatra in JRuby to provide a simple REST API
  for Lucene, and Sinatra in Ruby to provide the user-facing interface.
</p>

<p>Look at the code for <a href="http://github.com/bernerdschaefer/rucene">rucene</a>.</p>

<h4>DRb</h4>
<p>
  When you need to use JRuby, but need much tighter integration between it and
  your main Ruby application than a REST API or separate process, you can use
  DRb. We looked at how Akephalos uses DRb to communicate between Capybara (an
  integration testing framework) and HTMLUnit (a headless browser build with
  Java).
