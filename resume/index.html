    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      To live in an amazing place, working with an awesome team to solve tough
      problems for real people.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>HR New Media GmbH <span class="date">dec 2010-present</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Built a PDF to HTML conversion tool, based on the PDF specification,
        with the goal of pixel-perfect conversions, including fonts and
        graphics. The front-end uses standard rails, and communicates with the
        backend over RabbitMQ.

      </li>

      <li>

        Restructured a monolithic rails application into a set of standlone
        services, communicating with simple REST APIs.

      </li>

      <li>

        Built a product recommendation engine on top of MongoDB. It runs on
        JRuby, and uses a mix of ad-hoc queries and client-side filtering to
        generate on-the-fly recommendations in response to REST calls to a
        Sinatra application.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hashrocket <span class="date">apr 2010-dec 2010</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Worked on-site with a client in Abu Dhabi, instilling best practices
        into their team and developing a working internal process so they could
        deliver their product. I also helped facilitate communication between
        the development teams in Abu Dhabi, Florida, and Chicago.

      </li>

      <li>

        Worked on a large-scale medical records application using Rails. We
        used MongoDB and Mongoid to great effect to ensure the application
        remained speedy while allowing users to view large amounts of data
        regarding each patient. I also helped break the large application into
        separate, manageable, components which communicated together as a service
        to maintain a rapid development process.

      </li>

      <li>

        Executed multiple code audits for potential clients, evaluating the
        quality of their code base and their team to help them decide the
        best way to bring their product to market.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wieck Media <span class="date">2007-mar 2010</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Worked with Rails, MERB, and a Rack-based framework Harbor, which I
        wrote to alleviate our internal development and deployment issues with
        other solutions.

      </li>
      <li>

        Built an automated email distribution system for TimesDigest, a New
        York Times company, which has delivered to date over 2.5 million emails
        to hotels, cruise ships, individuals, and military men and women around
        the world. The 5 thousand emails which go out each night are tracked
        for reception and bounces to calculate delivery rates and other
        important statistics.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Speaking Engagements</h2>
    <ul>

    <h3>Current Project</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped">Moped</a> &mdash; an
      alternative MongoDB driver written entirely in Ruby. It offers comparable
      speed to the c-extension powered mongo-ruby-driver on MRI, and a
      significant boost in speed on JRuby. Moped is now the driver used for
      Mongoid.
    </p>
