    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      To live in an amazing place, working with an awesome team to solve tough
      problems for real people.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Hashrocket <span class="date">apr 2010-present</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Worked on-site with a client in Abu Dhabi, instilling best practices
        into their team and developing a working internal process so they could
        deliver their product. I also helped facilitate communication between
        the teams spread between Abu Dhabi, Florida, and Chicago.

      </li>

      <li>

        Worked on a large-scale medical records application using Rails. We
        used MongoDB and Mongoid to great effect to ensure the application
        remained speedy while allowing users to view large amounts of data
        regarding each patient. I also helped break the large application into
        separate, manageable, components which communicated together as a service
        to maintain a rapid development process.

      </li>

      <li>

        Executed multiple code audits for potential clients, evaluating the
        quality of their code base and their team to help them decide the
        best way to bring their product to market.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wieck Media <span class="date">2007-mar 2010</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Worked with Rails, MERB, and a Rack-based framework Harbor, which I
        wrote to alleviate our internal development and deployment issues with
        other solutions.

      </li>
      <li>

        Built an automated email distribution system for TimesDigest, a New
        York Times company, which has delivered to date over 2.5 million emails
        to hotels, cruise ships, individuals, and military men and women around
        the world. The 5 thousand emails which go out each night are tracked
        for reception and bounces to calculate delivery rates and other
        important statistics.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accelerated Sales Inc. <span class="date">2005-2007</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Built a Rails application to track the performance of the two-person
        company's one-hundred contractors throughout the US, including
        automated scoring and targeted feedback from the contractors' reports.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Coram Deo Academy <span class="date">2003-2005</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Worked with school administrators to replace their proprietary and
        out-dated registrar system with a web application. It handled
        enrollment applications, course scheduling, grade reporting, transcript
        generation, and more. The Ô¨Årst few months of work were done in PHP, but
        was rewritten in Rails over a weekend in the later part of 2004.
