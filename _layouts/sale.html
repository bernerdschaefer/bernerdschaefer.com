        So here's the deal. My wife and I moving to Germany and selling
        everything we own.  I start December 6th, so I need to try and clear
        out as quickly as possible.  With your help, we can make this move
        happen!

        <strong>Also, we're looking for someone to sublet our
          apartment.</strong> It's in a great part of Lincoln Park, with a
        lofted bedroom / bathroom. Rent is surprisingly inexpensive for such
        a nice little apartment. Let us know if you're interested.
