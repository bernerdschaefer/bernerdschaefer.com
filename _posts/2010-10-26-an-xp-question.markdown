title: "An XP Question"
---

I recently finished reading Kent Beck's _Extreme Programming Explained_ for the
first time. It's really an amazing book, and if you haven't read it you should
do so
[now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658?ie=UTF8&tag=oinopont-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0321278658).

But I was a bit confused by something, especially thinking about applying XP to
a consultancy rather than a team embedded in an organization. Here are two
quotes to consider ---

The question is this. **If you are writing and estimating stories at the same
time, and writing them each week, how do you determine a client's budget and
time requirements?**

I'm conflicted by this. Writing and estimating stories before work has
started---or even before you know who will be working on the project---feels
more like "requirements gathering" than something belonging to an agile team.
And yet it gives you good ground for estimating time-to-launch and budget for a
client: "Historically we deliver an average of _x_ points per week, so unless
we reduce the scope you're looking at an approximate launch date of _y_."

How have you solved this?
